#SwiP - Switch profiles intelligently

This is an android application in the making, which allows the user to create and edit several profiles(which contain volume and connectivity settings so far) and to switch between them in an easy manner. As for now switching profiles by widgets, notification, lockscreen-widget and in-app is working, but there will be more options in the future.. The basic functionality should be working right now, look in the download section to get a working copy.
(We decided to move from Git to Mercurial, so everything is starting from zero)
